## Goal
The premise of the game is to have a grid of 24 face-down cards. The card faces consist of pairs of matches. Clicking on cards will flip them over, revealing the value. When two are chosen, if it's a match, both cards will disappear. If it's not, the cards will flip back over to face-down. The game should be different every time the game is refreshed.
## Plan
Display 12 cards.
Duplicate the cards to have 2 sets of 12.
Randomize the display of cards.
Add selected style for selected cards.
Only allow two cards to be selected at a time.
Determine if two selected cards are a match and hide them.
Reset guess count after 2.
Add delay to selections.
Show back of card initially and flip on select
Finished game!
